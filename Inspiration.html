      <p class="w3-text-grey">My passion for cooking is also largely influenced by my family, as they enjoy cooking a lot too. I recall with fondness the times that I
	will stand beside my grandmother and watch her cook whilst enthusiastically asking her what ingredients she was putting in next. Therefore, a big part of food and cooking
	lies in its power to bring people together to spend a wonderful time. </P><br>
	
	<p class="w3-text-grey">Watching cooking videos on Youtube has also inspired me to cook better as I would draw inspiration
	from the videos and try to recreate the dish by myself. Here are some Youtube cooking channels I follow! I have been watching them for many many years...</p><br>

  <p class="w3-text-grey">Also, I recently got a new cookbook named <b><i>Dessrt Person</b></i> by Claire Saffitz. As much as I don't have a sweet tooth (and Claire Saffitz mainly does 
  desserts and sweets, I fell head over heels with her recipe book mainly because <b>I LOVE HER</b>. But also, her recipes reflect her beliefs and attitudes towards baking and cooking in general,
  as she wants to show how versatile and flexible baking can be. I personally don't bake often because I admit that I can be daunted by the task at times. Buying Claire's book
  gives me the confidence that I need because her recipes are simple, delicious yet practical. She has since converted me that being a "dessert person" is not just a person who likes sweets,
  but it is an attitude. </p><br>
